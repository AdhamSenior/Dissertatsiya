TERMS AND CONDITIONS

1. This Software is protected by copyright law and
international copyright treaty. Therefore, you must
treat this Software just like a book, except that you
may copy it onto a computer to be used and you may
make archive copies of the Software for the sole
purpose of backing up our Software and protecting your
investment from loss. This Software is experimental,
which means it is still under development and may
contain bugs. Accordingly, your use of this Software is
limited to evaluation and trial use purposes only.

2. FURTHER, THIS SOFTWARE MAY CONTAIN A TIME-OUT
FEATURE THAT DISABLES ITS OPERATION AFTER A CERTAIN
PERIOD OF TIME. IN THE EVENT THAT THE SOFTWARE INCLUDES
A TIME-OUT FEATURE, YOU SHOULD REFER TO THE DOCUMENTATION
PROVIDED WITH THE SOFTWARE, INCLUDING ANY ON-LINE
DOCUMENTATION, FOR DETERMINING THE TIME PERIOD AND/OR
SPECIFIC DATE UPON WHICH THE SOFTWARE WILL EXPIRE.
Though Borland does not offer technical support for
the Software, we welcome your feedback.

3. If the Software is a Borland development tool, you can
write and compile applications for your own personal use
on the computer on which you have installed the Software,
but you do not have a right to distribute or otherwise share
those applications or any files of the Software which may be
required to support those applications. APPLICATIONS THAT
YOU CREATE MAY REQUIRE THE SOFTWARE IN ORDER TO RUN. UPON
EXPIRATION OF THE EVALUATION PERIOD, THOSE APPLICATIONS MAY
NO LONGER RUN. You should therefore take precautions to
avoid any loss of data that might result.

4. BORLAND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS ABOUT THE SUITABILITY
OF THIS SOFTWARE OR ABOUT ANY CONTENT OR INFORMATION MADE
ACCESSIBLE BY THE SOFTWARE, FOR ANY PURPOSE. THE SOFTWARE
IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES,
INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR
A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NONINFRINGEMENT. THIS SOFTWARE IS
PROVIDED GRATUITOUSLY AND, ACCORDINGLY, BORLAND.COM SHALL
NOT BE LIABLE UNDER ANY THEORY OR ANY DAMAGES SUFFERED BY
YOU OR ANY USER OF THE SOFTWARE. BORLAND.COM WILL NOT
SUPPORT THIS SOFTWARE AND IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO ISSUE
UPDATES TO THIS SOFTWARE.

5. While Borland intends to distribute a commercial
release of the Software, Borland reserves the right at
any time not to release a commercial release of the Software

capabilities, functions, licensing terms, release dates,
general availability or other characteristics of the
commercial release.

6. Title, ownership rights, and intellectual property rights
in and to the Software shall remain in Borland and/or its
suppliers. You agree to abide by the copyright law and all
other applicable laws of the United States including, but not
limited to, export control laws. You acknowledge that the
Software in source code form remains a confidential trade
secret of Borland and/or its suppliers and therefore you
agree not to modify the Software or attempt to decipher,
decompile, disassemble, or reverse engineer the Software,
except to the extent applicable laws specifically prohibit
such restriction.

7. Within thirty (30) days following Borland's release of a
commercial version of the Software, you agree to destroy or
erase the Software. This statement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of
California and, as to matters affecting copyrights, trademarks
and patents, by U.S. federal law. This statement sets forth the
entire agreement between you and Borland.

8. Use, duplication or disclosure by the Government is subject
to restrictions set forth in subparagraphs (a) through (d)
of the Commercial Computer-Restricted Rights clause at
FAR 52.227-19 when applicable, or in subparagraph (c) (1)
(ii) of the Rights in Technical Data and Computer Software

9. You may not download or otherwise export or reexport the
Software or any underlying information or technology except in

none of the Software or underlying information or

or a national or resident of any such country or on any such
list.

10. BORLAND OR ITS SUPPLIERS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR
(a) INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL OR INDIRECT DAMAGES
OF ANY SORT, WHETHER ARISING IN TORT, CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE,
EVEN IF BORLAND.COM HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES, OR (b) FOR ANY CLAIM BY ANY OTHER PARTY. THIS
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR
DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. FURTHERMORE, SOME STATES DO
NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION AND EXCLUSION MAY
NOT APPLY TO YOU.

11. HIGH RISK ACTIVITIES. The Software is not fault-
tolerant and is not designed, manufactured, or intended for
use or resale as online control equipment in hazardous
environments requiring fail-safe performance, such as in the
operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation or

machines, or weapons systems, in which the failure of the
Software could lead directly to death, personal injury, or
severe physical or environmental damage ("High Risk

any express or implied warranty of fitness for High Risk
